# Fetal-Monitoring-System
This project aims to develop a non-invasive, cost-effective fetal movement monitoring system using the ESP32 microcontroller and MPU6050 accelerometers. The primary objective is to enable pregnant mothers to monitor fetal movements at home, thus ensuring continuous fetal health monitoring without frequent clinical visits.
